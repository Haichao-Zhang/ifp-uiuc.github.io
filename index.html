            <h4>About IFP Group</h4>
            <p>The IFP Group was founded by Professor Thomas S. Huang in the late 80s, started as Image Formation and Processing Group at Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology.
                Over the years, the IFP Group has pursued research and innovation beyond images, inlcuding Image and Video Coding, Multimodal Human Computer Interaction, Multimedia Annotation and Search, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning, Big Data, Deep Learning and High Performance Computing.
                <b>The current IFP research direction is to solve problems in multimodal information processing by synergistically combining Big Data, Deep Learning, and High Performance Computing.
                IFP has been famous for having an environment conducive to innovative/independent research. Of course, most of the research projects need eventually align with the main research theme.</b>
 </p>
            <p> In a more general sense, the IFP Group includes friends, students, students of students, students of students of students, or even students of students of students of students since Professor Huang's starting as a faculty member at MIT in the 1960s.
                The IFPers have proudly accomplished numerous cutting edge research projects in collaboration with academia, industry and goverment agencies, awarded multiple best papers at top conferences in AI, and won many international competitions including the first NIST TrecVID, the first ImageNet Challenge, and the first AI City Challenge.
                Our IFP Alumni strive to make a difference in both academia and industry, and some even lead expeditions from engineering to laws, humanities, and arts.
                Above all, we stay together as a proud IFP Family.
